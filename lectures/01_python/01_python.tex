% About Python

%why python
%- high level, fast prototyping, full-stack of packages/tools for scientific computations (often internally implemented in C)

%    CPython \textit{extension module}: Python module not written in Python.
%
%    \pause
%
%    Most often written in C or \cpp{}.
%
%    \pause
%
%    \hrulefill
%
%    \textit{Why bother?}
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item \pause Interfacing with existing libraries
%        \item \pause Writing performance-critical code
%        \item \pause Mirroring library API in Python to aid prototyping
%        \item \pause Running tests for non-Python libraries in Python
%    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Installation}
%    It is possible to write CPython extension modules in pure C, but...
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item \pause Manual refcounting
%        \item \pause Manual exception handling
%        \item \pause Boilerplate to define functions and modules
%        \item \pause High entry barrier, prone to programmer errors
%        \item \pause Differences in the API between Python versions
%    \end{itemize}

\section{Language Basics}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Code structure, Comments}
	Code structure
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \pause Python uses \textbf{indentation} (whitespace) to separate blocks.
		\item \pause Only relative indentation among blocks matters.
		\item \pause Consistent indentation within a block.
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
    \begin{pythoncode}
		>>> if a < 5:
		...    print('line one')
		...      print('line two') # --> IndentationError exception.
    \end{pythoncode}

    \pause

    Comments
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \pause Single-line comments, multi-line comments (docstring)
    \end{itemize}

	\pause
	 \begin{pythoncode}
	# I am a single line comment.
	""" I am
	a multi-line comment. """
	\end{pythoncode}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Types - Basics}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \pause Every value has a data type.
	\item \pause But you don't declare it, Python infers it from \textbf{assignment}.
	\end{itemize}

	 \begin{pythoncode}
		>>> my_var = 12.17   # "my_var" is treated as float
	\end{pythoncode}

	\pause
	Native Python data types:
	
	 \begin{pythoncode}
		>>> i = 42      # int
		>>> f = 3.14159 # float
		>>> c = 2 + 3j  # complex
		>>> b = True    # bool
		>>> s = 'spam'  # str
		>>> n = None    # NoneType (think of as "null")
	\end{pythoncode}

	\pause
	More complex native data types: tuple, set, list, dict
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Types - Lifetime, Introspection}
	
	\pause
	The data type can change during runtime.
	
	\pause	
	\begin{pythoncode}
		>>>  idk = 25      # Python treats "idk" as int.
		>>>  idk = 'eggs'  # Perfectly valid, now "idk" is str.
	\end{pythoncode}
	
	\pause
	Checking the data type:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \pause \small{\texttt{type()}, \texttt{dir()}, \texttt{help()}}
		\item \pause \small{\texttt{instanceof()}}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pause
	\begin{pythoncode}
		>>> val = 2.718
		>>> type(val)
		<class float>
		>>> instanceof(val, float)
		True
	\end{pythoncode}
\end{frame}

	>>> my_list = ['zero', 1, 2.0, 3 + 0j]

		# Retrieve item (indexing from 0!).
		>>> my_list[2]

		>>> my_list[2] = 'two_point_o'  # Item assignment. 
	\end{pythoncode}

	\begin{pythoncode}

	\begin{pythoncode}
		# Append the value to the end.

        ...     return a*b - c, a*b + c

    \end{pythoncode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Control Flow - Loops}

    Iterate over lists:

\section{Misc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Arithmetic operators}

    \begin{pythoncode}
        # +, -, /, //, *, **
        >>> 1 + 2
        3

    Floating point vs. integer division:

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> 2 / 3
        0.6666666666666666

        >>> 2 // 3
        0
    \end{pythoncode}

    \pause

    Exponentiation:

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> 2 ** 3
        8
    \end{pythoncode}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Boolean operators}

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> True and False
        False
        >>> True or False
        True
        >>> not False

    \begin{pythoncode}
        # Short-circuiting behaviour
        >>> def fun(i):

        ...     return i

        >>> True or fun(1)
        True
    \end{pythoncode}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Console output}

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
    \end{pythoncode}

    \pause

    Formatted strings (similar to \texttt{printf} in C):

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> print("Int: %d, Float: %f, String: %s" % (5, 3.14, 'foo'))
        Int: 5, Float: 3.140000, String: foo
    \end{pythoncode}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Packages}

    Load more functionality from (external) packages / files:

    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> import numpy
        >>> numpy.pi
        3.141592653589793
    \end{pythoncode}

    \pause

    Attention: This overwrites any prior definition of \texttt{pi}!
    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> from numpy import pi
        >>> pi
        3.141592653589793
    \end{pythoncode}

    \pause

    Often a good ideas to keep things in their own namespaces instead:
    \begin{pythoncode}
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> np.pi
        3.141592653589793
